# Randomized optimization
Trying 4 randomized optimization algorithms (simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, MIMIC and random hill climbing) on Traveling Salesperson, Four peaks, and 2-Color Maximization problems.

Also using those algorithms to fit the weights of a neural network and comparing with gradient decent.

## Required packages
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- mlrose
- mlrose_hiive

## Running the code
Link to github with notebook : https://github.com/aymane399/Randomized-Optimization
Follow the jupyter cell by cell to obtain the exact same results.
analysis is done on PDF file.
